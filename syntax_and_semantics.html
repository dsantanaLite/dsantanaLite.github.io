			<ul class='syntax'>
					<li>
						 Need for parenthesis around all forms.
						 Decreases writability and gives greater chance of trivial mistakes. The convention of
						 leaving closing parens on the same line can decrease readability as well. 
					</li>
					<li>Function definitions do not define argument type or return type</li>
					<li>Code is generally very concise</li>
			</ul>

			<li><h3>Semantics</h3></li>
			<ul class='syntax'>
					<li>When creating local names using Let, they have Lexical Scope</li>
					<li>When binding Vars, they have dynamic scope, and can not be seen by any other threads.</li>
					<li>
					Constants can be declared when using def to create a Var, in which case you will add const metadata to the Var
					<br>This metadata can be added to different kinds of objects as well, and is stored as a map to the Var.
					</li>
					<li>Garbage collection is done by taking advatage of the JVM.</li>

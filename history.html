				In short, I think Clojure occupies a unique niche as a functional Lisp for the JVM with strong concurrency support.

			 - Rich Hickey, author of Clojure

			<p>
				Clojure was created to be useful in the same ways as an object oriented language like Java, while at the same time being a dialect of Lisp, and providing the immutability of a functional language.

				Clojure 1.0.0 was released in July, 2009, and is being regularly updated today through community development, with the last stable release being <a href="https://clojure.org/community/downloads">Clojure 1.8.0</a> in Jan 2016.
				A notable library released in 2011 is ClojureScript, which aims to be a more powerful, robust language that can accomplish all that JavaScript can using the same syntax as Clojure. End of year surveys show that ClojureScript is gaining more adopters every year and is even being used independently of Clojure itself.   
			</p>

			<p>
				 Clojure has seen success in the corporote world as well, with Walmart using Clojure to build a data management system which needs to hold up against Black Friday shopping, as well as companies such as Cicayda and Precursor taking advantage of Clojure along with ClojureScript to build their web applications.

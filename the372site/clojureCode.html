    ;  Description: This program reads in a list of points from a file 
    ;               titled 'input.txt'. The file should consist of three
    ;               lines: one line of testing points, one line of the
    ;               first training set of points, and one last line of 
    ;               the second set of training points. Points take the
    ;               form of two numbers separated by a comma. Points are
    ;               separated by white space. Thus, the contents of the
    ;               file should look something like this:
    ;                  x1,y1 x2,y2
    ;                  x3,y3 x4,y4
    ;                  x5,y5 x6,y6
    ;               The program then uses a k Nearest Neighbors algorithm
    ;               (k = 3) to determine which group each testing point
    ;               belongs to. Each testing point along with its
    ;               corresponding group is printed to stdout.
    ;

    ; square
    ;
    ; Purpose: Calculates the square of a value x (x^2)
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   x -- The integer value to square
    (defn square [x]
      (* x x))

    ; distance
    ;
    ; Purpose: Calculates the distance between two points of the form
    ;   [x y]. Returns the result as a floating point value.
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   point1 -- The first point [x1 y1]
    ;   point2 -- The second point [x2 y2]
    (defn distance [point1 point2]
      (let [[x1 y1] point1 [x2 y2] point2]
        (java.lang.Math/sqrt (+ (square (- x1 x2)) (square (- y1 y2))))))

    ; toNum
    ;
    ; Purpose: Converts the given string to an Integer.
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   str -- The string to be converted.
    (defn toNum [str]
      (Integer/parseInt str))

    ; convertToNumPair
    ;
    ; Purpose: Transforms a list of string representations of a point "x,y" to numerical
    ;   representations [x y]. 
    ;
    ; Parameter:
    ;   strPoints -- A list of string representation of points
    (defn convertToNumPair [strPoints]
      (if (not= (count strPoints) 0)
      (let [point (str/split (first strPoints) #",")]
        (conj (convertToNumPair (rest strPoints)) [(toNum (get point 0)) (toNum (get point 1))]))))

    ; makePoints
    ;
    ; Purpose: Creates a list of points of the form [[x1 y1] [x2 y2] etc.] from a string of
    ;   points of the form "x1,y1 x2,y2, etc."
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   line -- A string of points separated by white space.
    (defn makePoints [line]
      (let [strPoints (str/split line #" ")] ; Split the line into points
        (convertToNumPair strPoints))) ; Convert points from strings to numbers

    ; closest
    ;
    ; Purpose: Creates a list of distances from the given testPoint to each
    ;   point in the given list of points.
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   points -- A list of points in the form of [x y]
    ;   testPoint -- A single point in the form of [x y]
    (defn closest [points testPoint]
      (sort (map (partial distance testPoint) points)))

    ; compareDist
    ;
    ; Purpose:  Compares two vectors of distances until 3 comparisons
    ;   have been made. If the first distance is smaller, 1 is added to the
    ;   result. If the second distance is smaller, 1 is subtracted from the
    ;   result. In the case of a tie, the result is not changed.
    ;
    ; Parameters:
    ;   dist1 & dists1 -- A list of distances from a test point to the first training set
    ;   dist2 & dists2 -- A list of distances from a test point to the second training set
    ;   count          -- The number of comparisons made thus far.
    (defn compareDist [[dist1 & dists1] [dist2 & dists2] count] ; take first distance from each list
      (cond
        (or (nil? dist1) (nil? dist2) (>= count 3)) 0 ; Stop if 3 comparisons have been made or no more distances
        (= dist1 dist2) (+ 0 (compareDist dists1 dists2 (+ count 2))) ; Tie; don't change result
        (< dist1 dist2) (+ 1 (compareDist dists1 (conj dists2 dist2) (inc count))) 
        :else           (- (compareDist (conj dists1 dist1) dists2 (inc count)) 1)))

    ; closestGroup
    ; 
    ; Purpose:  Determines which training group the given point belongs to.
    ;   A positive value indicates it belongs to group 1, a negative value 
    ;   indicates it belongs to group 2, and a value of 0 indicates a tie.

    ; Parameters:
    ;   point -- A vector in the form of [x, y]
    (defn closestGroup [point]
      (let [closest1 (closest trainingPoints1 point) closest2 (closest trainingPoints2 point)]
        (compareDist (take 3 closest1) (take 3 closest2) 0)))


    ; Main
    ; Read in the lines from the input file
    (let [rdr (reader "input.txt")]
      (def lines (line-seq rdr))) ; A sequence of lines in the file

    ; Read in testing data points
    (def testingPoints (makePoints (first lines)))
    (def lines (rest lines))

    ; Read in first set of training points
    (def trainingPoints1 (makePoints (first lines)))
    (def lines (rest lines))

    ; Read in second set of training points
    (def trainingPoints2 (makePoints (first lines)))

    ; Loop through each testing point and determine which group
    ; it belongs to.
    (loop [[point & more] testingPoints]
      (if-not (= point nil) ; Continue until no more testing points
        (do 
          (let [closestResult (closestGroup point)]
            (cond
              (< 0 closestResult) (println (str point ": group 1"))
              (> 0 closestResult) (println (str point ": group 2"))
              :else               (println (str point ": tie"))))
          (recur more))
        )
